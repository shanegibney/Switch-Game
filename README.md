# Switch Game

* Press 'Go' and the switches will rotate 90 degrees clockwise or anti-clockwise. The ones which align will not be in a faded colour.

* To complete this game, I would like a switch coloured black or something obvious to representa player. The player can move to a faded switch, one move after each rotation of the switches. The idea to traverse the board in as few moves as possible.

* There could be up to four players, the objective for each is to cross to the opposite side. The player who makes it in the fewest moves wins.

* Also random 'nasty switches' could return a player to the edge of the board again.

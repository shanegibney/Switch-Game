# Switch Game

* Press 'Go' and the switches will rotate 90 degrees clockwise or anti-clockwise. The ones which align will not be in a faded colour.

* To complete this game, I would like a switch coloured black or something obvious to represent a player. The player can move to a faded switch, one move after each rotation of the switches. The idea is to traverse the board in as few moves as possible.

* There could be up to four players, the objective for each is to cross to the opposite side. The player who makes it in the fewest moves wins.

* Also random 'nasty switches' could return a player to the edge of the board again or if you end up side by side with another player, you are both returned to your respective edge of the board.

* The four sides of the board have colours for the player who started there.

* A short snake-like wall could weave it's way randomly between the switches, further inhibiting progress.
